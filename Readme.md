* Records
* Type union
* Type sets â€” something similar to a heterogeneous list, like `HList` from shapeless, with the difference that it can store only things of different types. Also it provides some basic operations on these sets and one of them is a _fast_ check that a type is in the set (in compile time) without traversing the set.


### Usage

libraryDependencies += "ohnosequences" %% "cosas" % "0.6.0" // not released yet
```

The artifact is published only for scala `2.11.2`.
